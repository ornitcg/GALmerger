# GALmerger
A GAL file is a text file that contains information about microarray , printed by a Scienion machine.
This file matches names to coordinates on a a printed slide.
Sometime a project is composed of several printing sessions with different plans
and the final analsys requires a unite file. so I wrote this Python code for merging 
multiple GAL files of one printing project into one file.
