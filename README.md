# GALmerger Description
GAL is the extension for a text file that contains a microarray image key data.
This file matches names to coordinates on the microarray image, for later image analysis.
Sometimes a microarray project is composed of several printing sessions, and there is a 
separate GAL file for each session. The final analysis requires a united file so I wrote this Python code for merging 
multiple GAL files of one printing project into one .
